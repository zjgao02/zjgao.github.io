I am currently a junior undergraduate student in Shandong University, majoring in software engineering. I joined IDEA Group led by professor Guo-Xian Yu in my sophomore year. I focus on data mining and machine learning, especially, the problems of multi-modal learning in practical applications such as long-tail, zero-shot and so on. If interested, feel free to email me at **zjgao@mail.sdu.edu.cn** to let me work with you as a PhD.

I won the **National Scholarship** in 2021 and won the first-class scholarship for academic studies and the first-class scholarship for entrepreneurship and so on.
